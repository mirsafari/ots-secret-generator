# ots-secret-generator
OTS secret generator is designed to create random passwords and automatically stores them to OTS service (https://github.com/onetimesecret/onetimesecret) using its API. 

After generation, it prints plain text passwords and links to its corresponding OTS URL. It helps to generate secrets when you need to share passwords with a large number of different users.

The generator was tested on local OTS instance version 0.10.1.-49f3761b-en

## Quickstart
**0.** Have a running instance of OTS
**1.** Create Account and generate an API key on OTS service
**2.** Download the binary depending on your host system
**3.** Setup configuration file
**4.** Run the binary with flags that point to the configuration file and number of passwords you wish to generate. 

Example of successful run (on Linux):

```bash
./ots-secret-generator --config ./config.json --passwords 3 
```

```bash
Configuration successfully loaded.
OTS service reachable. Healthcheck response: {"status":"nominal","locale":"en"}

```

Generator acepts --config flag and --passwords flag that defines number of passwords/secrets to generate.

## Configuration
Generator checks for configuration file (default: config.json) that is provided with --config argument. Below you can see a valid configuration file. 

NOTE: All fields are required.

```json
{
    "endpoint" : "https://ots.domain.tld",
    "username" : "user@domain.tld",
    "api-key" : "df30e824932493f1ace2aa2493249369eea9008",
    "secret-ttl": 36000,
    "password-length" : 3
}
```

- **endpoint** : location where OTS is located. Only write protocol (HTTP/HTTPS) and hostname. The path to API is automatically appended
- **username**: OTS username
- **api-key**: API key that was generated for your user 
- **secret-ttl**: The remaining time (in seconds) that the secret has left to live inside OTS service before is beeing read
- **password-length**: Length of the generated password

## Additional info
- Password is generated from following character sets:
    - abcdedfghijklmnopqrst
	- ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ
    - !@#$%&*
	- 0123456789

- Maximum number of passwords generated at once is **150**
